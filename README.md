## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

The Most I learned from this project was being able to move objects/ things on a wbe page using CSS and HTML. Getting the objects right where i wanted them was a bit challenging but very useful once I understood how to do so.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 body { 
      background-color: rgb(246, 207, 66);
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      height: 100vh;
      margin: center; }
```
