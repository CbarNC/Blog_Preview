## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

The Most I learned from this project was being able to move objects/ things on a wbe page using CSS and HTML. Getting the objects right where i wanted them was a bit challenging but very useful once I understood how to do so.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 body { 
      background-color: rgb(246, 207, 66);
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      height: 100vh;
      margin: center; }
```
